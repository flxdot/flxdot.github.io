Welcome to the code behind the scenes of [fanghanel.dev](http://fanghanel.dev).

This endevor is foremost a exploration of [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and the tooling around it.
It was used to get into the Framework to see how it behaves in comparison to React or Vue3.
I furthermore wanted to explore some fancy other stuff as animate by scrolling,
as well as serving content from a JSON source.
The goal is to use as minimal dependencies as possible.
This way I can seperate the data (content) from the layout of the page.

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
